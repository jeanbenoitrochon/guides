# Guides

We produce guides to help developers at ESDC walk-though some complex procedures related to development. This project is used to store the guides for the DevCoP separately from the [root project (esdc-devcop.github.io)](https://github.com/esdc-devcop/esdc-devcop.github.io) while still hosted under the same website.  
See a [list of our guides](https://esdc-devcop.github.io/guides/).
